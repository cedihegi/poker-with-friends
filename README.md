# poker-with-friends

Very small server-client application that should enable you to play a little round of poker with some friends.
Basically a project to learn Node.js and some other Webdev concepts, because even though I am in my 3d year
of studying CS I still haven't been taught anything about this topic.

# Installation:
I would not recommend installing anything yet, this is work in progress, or work at it's very beginning
to be exact. So far this does 'ABSOLUTELY NOTHING'.

# License:
Intended for private use and only for play-money games.
